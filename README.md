Introduction
TikTok has taken the world by storm, and I couldn't resist exploring its data to gain insights into engagement rates and even attempt to predict them. In this project, I utilized Jupyter notebooks and various data analysis and machine learning techniques to unravel the mysteries behind TikTok's success. 📈

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

📁 data: This folder contains both the original data sources and the cleaned dataset that I used in my analysis and modeling.

📁 notebooks: Here, you can find Jupyter notebooks (named step 1 to step 4) that contain my data processing, model training code, and insightful analysis.

📁 pic: This folder showcases captivating visualizations from my exploratory data analysis. 📊

📁 plan&slides: In this directory, you'll find my initial capstone interest, progress standup presentations, and my final presentation. 🗣️

Data
The data folder is split into two subfolders:

📁 data/original: Contains the original data sources as obtained from various reputable TikTok datasets.

📁 data/cleaned: Contains the cleaned dataset ready for analysis, ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

Notebooks
The notebooks folder holds the heart of my project. It is organized sequentially into four notebooks:

📔 Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

I dive into the data, clean it, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
📔 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this notebook, I conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the TikTok engagement data.
📔 Step 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training

Here, I engineer relevant features and apply machine learning algorithms to predict engagement rates.
📔 Step 4: Model Evaluation and Conclusion

The final notebook evaluates the model's performance, draws conclusions, and provides insights for future work.
Visualization
The pic folder houses captivating visualizations that emerged during the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. These visual representations offer a glimpse of the intriguing patterns hidden within the data.

Plan & Slides
The plan&slides directory contains my project journey, from the initial capstone interest to progress standup presentations, and finally, the grand finale of my project - the final presentation.

Project Highlights
In-depth data analysis and visualization to understand TikTok engagement rates.
Utilization of machine learning algorithms for predicting engagement rates.
